gstreamer-java.licenseText=GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\
Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\
\n\
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n\
\n\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\
\n\
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\n\
\n\
0. Additional Definitions.\n\
As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\
\n\
"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\
\n\
An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\
\n\
A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".\n\
\n\
The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\
\n\
The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\
\n\
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\
\n\
2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\
\n\
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\
\n\
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\
4. Combined Works.\n\
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\
\n\
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n\
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\
d) Do one of the following:\n\
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n\
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n\
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\
5. Combined Libraries.\n\
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\
\n\
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
\n\
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\
\n\
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

junit-jupiter.licenseName=EPL 2.0
junit-jupiter.licenseText=Eclipse Public License - v 2.0\n\
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\
\n\
1. Definitions\n\
"Contribution" means:\n\
\n\
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and\n\
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n\
i) changes to the Program, and\n\
ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.\n\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\n\
\n\
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n\
\n\
"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n\
\n\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\n\
\n\
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\n\
\n\
"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.\n\
\n\
"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\n\
\n\
"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.\n\
\n\
"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.\n\
\n\
2. Grant of Rights\n\
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n\
\n\
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\
\n\
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\
\n\
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\
\n\
e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n\
\n\
3. Requirements\n\
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\
\n\
a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and\n\
\n\
b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n\
\n\
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\
iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\
iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.\n\
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\
\n\
a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n\
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.\n\
\n\
4. Commercial Distribution\n\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\
\n\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\
\n\
5. No Warranty\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\
\n\
6. Disclaimer of Liability\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
7. General\n\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\
\n\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\
\n\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.\n\
\n\
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n\
\n\
Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\n\
"This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."\n\
\n\
Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\n\
\n\
If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.\n\
\n\
You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n\
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software inSource Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version ofthis License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose tooffer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity orliability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf ofthe Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make itabsolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity orliability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agreeto indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for anyliability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as aresult of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software underthe terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Yourchoice, which may contain terms different from this License,provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this Licenseand that the license for the Executable form does not attempt tolimit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form fromthe rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the CoveredSoftware in Executable form under a different license, You must makeit absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this Licenseare offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer orContributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer andevery Contributor for any liability incurred by the InitialDeveloper or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\
3.6. Larger Works.\n\
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software withother code not governed by the terms of this License and distributethe Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must makesure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the CoveredSoftware.\n\
\n\
4. Versions of the License.\n\
4.1. New Versions.\n\
Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/ornew versions of this License from time to time. Each version will begiven a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modifythis License.\n\
4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make theCovered Software available under the terms of the version of theLicense under which You originally received the Covered Software. Ifthe Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Softwareprohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made availableunder any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute andmake the Covered Software available under the terms of the versionof the License under which You originally received the CoveredSoftware. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute orotherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of anysubsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n\
4.3. Modified Versions.\n\
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a newlicense for Your Original Software, You may create and use amodified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license andremove any references to the name of the license steward (except tonote that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwisemake it clear that the license contains terms which differ from thisLicense.\n\
\n\
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWAREIS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ORNON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OFTHE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVEDEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANYOTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES ANESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE ISAUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\
\n\
6. TERMINATION.\n\
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminateautomatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail tocure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond thetermination of this License shall survive.\n\
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excludingdeclaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or aContributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom Youassert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that theParticipant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where theParticipant is a Contributor or the Original Software where theParticipant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectlyinfringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly orindirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if theInitial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors underSections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days noticefrom Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at theexpiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the ParticipantSoftware against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant toa written agreement with Participant.\n\
6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participantalleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectlyinfringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as bylicense or settlement) prior to the initiation of patentinfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licensesgranted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be takeninto account in determining the amount or value of any payment orlicense.\n\
6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or anydistributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licensesgranted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\
\n\
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THEINITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OFCOVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLETO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, ORCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUTLIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTERFAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES ORLOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THEPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOTAPPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCHPARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCHLIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION ORLIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSIONAND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\
\n\
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is definedin 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computersoftware" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation"as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistentwith 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Softwarewith only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rightsclause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or otherclause or provision that addresses Government rights in computersoftware under this License.\n\

\n\
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor\n\
Boston, MA 02110-1335\n\
USA\n\
\n\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n\
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\
\n\
Preamble\n\
\n\
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\n\
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\n\
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\n\
make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\n\
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\n\
to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\n\
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\n\
Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\
\n\
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\n\
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\n\
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\n\
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n\
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n\
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\
\n\
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\n\
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\n\
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n\
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\
\n\
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n\
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\n\
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\n\
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\
\n\
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n\
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n\
distribute and/or modify the software.\n\
\n\
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n\
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n\
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n\
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n\
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n\
authors' reputations.\n\
\n\
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n\
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n\
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\n\
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\n\
be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\
\n\
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n\
modification follow.\n\
\n\
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
\n\
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\n\
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\n\
the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers\n\
to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means\n\
either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\n\
to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\n\
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n\
"modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".\n\
\n\
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n\
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\n\
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\n\
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n\
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\n\
is true depends on what the Program does.\n\
\n\
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\n\
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\n\
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\n\
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\n\
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\n\
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\
\n\
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n\
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\
\n\
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\n\
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\n\
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\n\
that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent noticesstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that inwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any partthereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third partiesunder the terms of this License.\n\
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactivelywhen run, you must cause it, when started running for suchinteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display anannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a noticethat there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide awarranty) and that users may redistribute the program under theseconditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does notnormally print such an announcement, your work based on the Programis not required to print an announcement.)\n\
\n\
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\n\
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\n\
can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n\
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n\
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\n\
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\n\
the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\n\
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n\
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\
\n\
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n\
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n\
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n\
collective works based on the Program.\n\
\n\
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n\
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\n\
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\n\
scope of this License.\n\
\n\
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n\
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n\
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readablesource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least threeyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your costof physically performing source distribution, a completemachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to bedistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a mediumcustomarily used for software interchange; or,\n\
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer todistribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowedonly for noncommercial distribution and only if you received theprogram in object code or executable form with such an offer, inaccord with Subsection b above.)\n\
\n\
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n\
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\n\
means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n\
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\n\
compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\n\
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\n\
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n\
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n\
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\n\
executable.\n\
\n\
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\n\
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n\
the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\n\
code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\n\
along with the object code.\n\
\n\
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n\
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n\
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\n\
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\n\
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\n\
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\n\
full compliance.\n\
\n\
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n\
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n\
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\n\
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\n\
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n\
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\n\
its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\n\
Program or works based on it.\n\
\n\
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n\
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n\
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n\
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\n\
on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\n\
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\
\n\
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n\
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n\
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n\
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n\
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\n\
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\n\
any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\n\
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\n\
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\n\
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\n\
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\n\
distribution of the Program.\n\
\n\
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n\
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n\
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n\
circumstances.\n\
\n\
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n\
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n\
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n\
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\n\
by public license practices. Many people have made generous\n\
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\n\
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\n\
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\n\
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\
\n\
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\n\
a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\
\n\
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n\
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n\
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\n\
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\n\
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\n\
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\n\
limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\
\n\
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n\
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\n\
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n\
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
\n\
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\n\
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any\n\
later version", you have the option of following the terms and\n\
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n\
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\n\
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\n\
Free Software Foundation.\n\
\n\
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n\
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\n\
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\n\
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\n\
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\n\
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\n\
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\
\n\
NO WARRANTY\n\
\n\
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n\
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n\
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\n\
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n\
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\n\
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\n\
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\n\
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\n\
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\
\n\
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n\
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n\
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\n\
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n\
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n\
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\n\
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\n\
THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\n\
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\
\n\
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\
\n\
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n\
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n\
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\
\n\
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\n\
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\n\
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\
One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modifyit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or(at your option) any later version.\n\
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, butWITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNUGeneral Public License for more details.\n\
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public Licensealong with this program; if not, write to the Free SoftwareFoundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA\n\
\n\
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\
\n\
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\n\
when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of authorGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type`show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistributeit under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\
\n\
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\n\
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\n\
you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\n\
could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\
\n\
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n\
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if\n\
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in theprogram `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written byJames Hacker.\n\
signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\
\n\
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\n\
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\n\
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications\n\
with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library\n\
General Public License instead of this License.\n\
\n\
#\n\
\n\
Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its\n\
affiliates are subject to the following clarification and special\n\
exception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its\n\
Classpath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only\n\
where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's\n\
header the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to\n\
the "Classpath" exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file\n\
that accompanied this code."\n\
\n\
You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent\n\
programs in this software package. Some of those programs are provided\n\
under licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software\n\
Foundation and others.  For example, the package includes programs\n\
licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Such programs are\n\
licensed to you under their original licenses.\n\
\n\
Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding\n\
the Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which\n\
permits you to use that code in combination with other independent\n\
modules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would\n\
not permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with\n\
Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such\n\
code into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then\n\
distributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the\n\
Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and\n\
distribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or\n\
all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and\n\
since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items\n\
included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath\n\
Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to\n\
further distribute the package.\n\
\n\
Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a\n\
lawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath\n\
Exception or making modifications to this package which may\n\
subsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party\n\
software.\n\
\n\
CLASSPATH EXCEPTION\n\
Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is\n\
making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and\n\
conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole\n\
combination.\n\
\n\
As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\n\
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\n\
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent\n\
modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under\n\
terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked\n\
independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that\n\
module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or\n\
